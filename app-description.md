# Select the Dress App Description
The following information summarizes what the app is and how it was designed.


## General Description
Select the Dress is an app that will allow users toÂ store and compare dresses they have tried on to help choose the perfect one. The user will add dresses that they want to compare. The user will upload a photo of them wearing the dress and add a rating for comparison to other dresses. Additional information such as designer, style number, price, store and notes may be added to each dress.

## Data Model
mLab is used to host the database for this app. There will be two models: user and occasion.

userSchema
```

  email: {type: String, required: true, unique: true},
  password: {type: String, required: true},
  firstName: {type: String, default: ''},
  lastName: {type: String, default: ''}

```

Sample user (note: email will always be lower case in the database):
```
const user = {
  id: '2575875c-711d-4670-a2a2-8f1f9ccc8d8b',
  email: 'john.smith@gmail.com',
  password: 'hash',
  firstName: 'john',

## Features to add if there is time
Allow different photo size upload.

Allow user's friends to rate dresses so user can sort by rating including how other's rated the dresses.

Add occasions dashboard so user can have the option to compare dresses for multiple occasions - wedding, wedding attendant, prom, etc.  Old data will need to be migrated if this is implemented.  When the user logs in they will be taken to the occasions page and can choose an occasion to see all dresses.  New endpoints that would be added:
* Occasions Dashboard - /occasions
    * List of occasions
    * Add new occasion button
* Add Occasion Form - /occasions/add
    * Name
    * Type (dropdown)
    * Date
    * Details
    * Submit

occasionSchema would look like this:
```
{
  id: {type: number, required: true, unique: true},
  userId: {type: number, required: true},
  occasionName: {type: Number, required: true},
  occasionType: {type: Number, required: true},
